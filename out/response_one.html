<p class="noindent">Great post, Marcella! I especially enjoyed your analysis in your second paragraph where you
  discussed the nasty things people tend to say when ﬁghting with those close to us. During the argument between Gary
  and Brooke, we deﬁnitely did not see any focus on one speciﬁc issue one person may have had with the other. Instead,
  we see them attempt to <span class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">tear each other apart </span>on a <span
    class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">person</span> and <span class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">character</span>-based level. This video was
  incredibly painful to watch and hit far too close to home, I am sure, for a lot of us!</p>

      style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;">Humans have many forms of emotion in them and nothing can
      turn on why humans are so emotional, especially women. It is evident from research that women are more emotional
      than men who use logic more than their emotions.New&nbsp;<a rel="noopener"

      positive emotion. However, McDuff and colleagues believe that smiling and other displays of positive emotion are
      only part of the picture. Emotions can be negative as well as positive, and within each valence there are a range
      of distinct emotional states, including fear, disgust, anger, joy, satisfaction, and
      gratitude.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: 0.01rem; font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;">&nbsp; It can
    be seen from what happened in the video of Brooke and Gary in the middle of an argument that from small to large.
    Sometimes when fighting with someone we already know closely, we often bring up problems that we shouldn't have. in
    any relationship it is not good to bury feelings and burdens in oneself. From the dialogue in the video, Brooke
    often comments on Gary because of his behavior at home, from his habits to Gary's physique. Indirectly, Brooke only
    conveyed his feelings that he did not want to keep because she could burden the life of this couple, but from Gary's
    view, he saw that Brooke did not give him space to rest from work, even though he worked so that he could support
    their household, but what that Brooke said when he got home was just babbling and complaining. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: 0.01rem; font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;">&nbsp; In the
    CRkit the solution to this problem is not escape but number 6, namely managing emotions. In a better relationship
    there are students who give in, there's no need to raise problems. Judging from what Brooke said there was a time
    when Gary took her to a place she didn't like, but because there was Gay she still went. Only because Gary didn't
    like ballet he decided not to go with Brooke's whim which was wrong. Expressing opinions and expressions is never
    wrong, what responders need is their openness to comments and suggestions that others have given to them. Sometimes
    the fault comes from the person providing comments and suggestions, they use emotion and pressure in speaking to
    stir up the other person's emotions.</span></p>
