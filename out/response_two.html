<p class="noindent">Interesting analysis, Cherylee! I agree with you on the fact that collaboration is important in a
  workplace environment. Have you ever been a part of a workplace environment where collaboration is diﬃcult, if not
  impossible, with your fellow coworkers (or, usually, management)? I know I personally have, and perhaps that is why I
  ﬁnd work to be an even more diﬃcult place to maintain solid foundations of conﬂict resolution when you just <span
    class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">know </span>you are the one in the right. Have you any tips/tricks/techniques to get around
  this in your own experience?</p>

<p dir="ltr">My favorite form of conflict resolution is collaboration.&nbsp; It is rarely used systematically in society
  itself, but it is incredible in the workplace.&nbsp; In collaboration we build relationships with other people and
  utilize the strengths and weaknesses of one another. The team uses partners from outside the collaboration such as
  industry partners to make a powerful decision the team can have all individual inputs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Collaboration can be effective because the return on investment in time can be maximized.&nbsp; In a good
  collaboration there is a massive amount of research and discussion completed.&nbsp; There should not be a lot of
  voting because that will limit the decision making.</p>
<p>In the current situation with COVID-19 where colleagues and team members are in completely different physical
  locations at an unprecedented level, it is even more essential to build collaborative skills to solve conflict .</p>
