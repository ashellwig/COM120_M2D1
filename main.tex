    \textbf{Overview}\\%
    We all deal with conflict differently. Some of us avoid an argument, while
      others escalate it. Perhaps you are willing to compromise, or maybe you
      would rather compete. As we saw in the movie clip, having different
      conflict resolution styles can make it very hard to reach an agreement.
      Even if you never change your conflict resolution method, being able to
      identify its strengths and weaknesses will help you become a better
      communicator.\\%

    You should spend approximately 4 hours on this assignment.%

    \subsection*{Instructions}
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item Be sure you have completed your readings and explored all the
          materials, including videos, in the Exploration page accessible within
          the ``Read/View'' topic of Module 2 Content.
        \item In the video appearing within the topic titled, ``Gender and
          Conflict'' we saw that Brooke and Gary had two very different ways of
          dealing with conflict, which caused a small disagreement to escalate
          into a huge argument.
        \item Click on the ``CR Kit'' Word Document link appearing on the fourth
          topic titled ``Improving Your Skills'' which is listed within
          ``Exploration of He Said! She Said'' under ``Read/Review''. Next,
          review the self-assessment content to determine your personal conflict
          resolution method (style).
          \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{NOTE}: There is NOT an assessment for you to complete.
              Again, REVIEW the self-assessment CONTENT to determine your
              personal conflict resolution method (style). If you find yourself
              equally split between two or more methods, then choose the one you
              feel is most important to you.
          \end{itemize}
        \item Conduct research of the conflict resolution method (style) you
          selected. For example what are the pros and cons of the conflict
          resolution method (style) based on your research?
      \end{enumerate}
